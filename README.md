# University Networking System (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project simulates the **network infrastructure of a university** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The objective is to design a scalable and optimized network that demonstrates real-world concepts such as **subnetting, routing protocols, and logical topology design**.

## Project Objective

- Design a structured and efficient network layout for a university.
- Apply **subnetting** to divide networks into logical sub-networks.
- Implement **routing protocols** for communication between departments and buildings.
- Optimize **topology** for better performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version recommended)
- Networking concepts: Subnetting, Static/Dynamic Routing
- Simulation tools for testing network performance

## How to Run the Project

1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the `.pkt` file included in this repository.
3. Use simulation mode to test and observe packet flow.
4. Modify or expand the topology for advanced scenarios.
